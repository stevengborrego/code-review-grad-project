# Webdev-Final-Project

This is a porftolio serving as the final project for CS510 Intro to Web Development at Portland State University. The page contains a short 'about me' section and contains a list of my education and CS related skills. It also contains links the the github pages of a couple projects I've worked on. It is a simple single-page website that uses HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and a trivial amount of jQuery.
